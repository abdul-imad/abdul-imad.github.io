                <h2 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Mahatma Gandhi's life:</h2>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1869</strong> - Born in Porbandar, India.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1882</strong> - At the age of 13, He wed Kasturba Makanji, a merchant’s daughter, in an
                        arranged marriage.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1888</strong> - 18 year old Gandhi went to London, England to study Law.The young Indian
                        struggled with the transition to Western culture.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1891</strong> - After completing the study of Law, he returned to India and learned that
                        his mother had just few weeks earlier. He struggled to gain his footing as a lawyer. In his
                        first courtroom case, a nervous Gandhi blanked when the time came
                        to cross-examine a witness. He immediately fled the courtroom after reimbursing his client for
                        his legal fees.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1893</strong> - After struggling to find work as a lawyer in India, Gandhi obtained a
                        one-year contract to perform legal services in
                        South Africa. He sailed for Durban in the South African state of Natal.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1893</strong> - After ariving in South Africa, he was quickly appalled by the
                        discrimination and racial segregation faced by Indian immigrants at the hands of white
                        British and Boer authorities. Upon his first appearance in a Durban courtroom, Gandhi was asked
                        to remove his turban. He
                        refused and left the court instead. The Natal Advertiser mocked him in print as “an unwelcome
                        visitor.”</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1893</strong> - A seminal moment occurred during a train trip to Pretoria,
                        South Africa, when a white man objected his presence in the first-class railway compartment,
                        although he had a ticket. Refusing to
                        move to the back of the
                        train, he was forcibly removed and thrown off the train at a station in Pietermaritzburg.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1894</strong> - After completing one year contract in South Africa, he returned to
                        India.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1906</strong> - He organized his first mass civil-disobedience campaign, which he
                        called “Satyagraha” (“truth and firmness”), in
                        reaction to the South African Transvaal government’s new restrictions on the rights of Indians,
                        including the refusal to
                        recognize Hindu marriages.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1915</strong> - He founded an ashram in Ahmedabad, India, that was open to all castes.
                        Wearing a simple loincloth and shawl,
                        he lived an austere life devoted to prayer, fasting and meditation. He became known as
                        “Mahatma,” which means “great
                        soul.”</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1930</strong> - He returned to active politics to protest Britain’s Salt Acts, which not
                        only prohibited Indians from
                        collecting or selling salt—a dietary staple—but imposed a heavy tax that hit the country’s
                        poorest particularly hard.
                        He planned a new Satyagraha campaign, The Salt March, that entailed a 390-kilometer/240-mile
                        march to the Arabian
                        Sea, where he would collect salt in symbolic defiance of the government monopoly.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>1942</strong> - As Great Britain found itself engulfed in World War II, Gandhi launched
                        the “Quit India” movement that called
                        for the immediate British withdrawal from the country. Few weeks later, the British arrested
                        Gandhi, his wife and other
                        leaders of the Indian National Congress and detained them in the Aga Khan Palace in present-day
                        Pune.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1944</strong> - With his health failing, he was released after a 19-month detainment.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1945</strong> - After the Labour Party defeated Churchill’s Conservatives in the British
                        general election, it began negotiations
                        for Indian independence with the Indian National Congress and Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s Muslim
                        League. Gandhi played an
                        active role in the negotiations, but he could not prevail in his hope for a unified India.
                        Instead, the final plan
                        called for the partition of the subcontinent along religious lines into two independent
                        states—predominantly Hindu India
                        and predominantly Muslim Pakistan.

                        Violence between Hindus and Muslims flared even before independence took effect on August 15,
                        1947. Afterwards, the
                        killings multiplied. Gandhi toured riot-torn areas in an appeal for peace and fasted in an
                        attempt to end the bloodshed.
                        <b>Some Hindus, however, increasingly viewed Gandhi as a traitor for expressing sympathy toward
                            Muslims</b>.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>1948</strong> - On January 30, 78-year-old Gandhi was shot and killed by Hindu extremist
                        Nathuram Godse, who was upset at Gandhi’s
                        tolerance of Muslims.

                <p>"Gandhi resisted evil with as much vigor and power as the violent resister, but he resisted with love
                    instead of hate.
                    True pacifism is not unrealistic submission to evil power. It is rather a courageous confrontation
                    of evil by the power
                    of love."</p>
